# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset provided by YBI Foundation.

## 📁 Dataset Features
- Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.
- Target: Diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- RandomForestClassifier
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🎯 Project Goal
To train a classification model that accurately predicts cancer diagnosis using real medical data.

## 🧪 Accuracy
Achieved over *95% accuracy* on the test set.

## 📂 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure cancer.csv is placed inside a folder named data/
3. Run cancer_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab
